Subject: [PATCH 1/3] mm: workingset: remove local_irq_disable() from
 count_shadow_nodes()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.18/older/patches-4.18.7-rt5.tar.xz

In commit 0c7c1bed7e13 ("mm: make counting of list_lru_one::nr_items
lockless") the
	spin_lock(&nlru->lock);

statement was replaced with
	rcu_read_lock();

in __list_lru_count_one(). The comment in count_shadow_nodes() says that
the local_irq_disable() is required because the lock must be acquired
with disabled interrupts and (spin_lock()) does not do so.
Since the lock is replaced with rcu_read_lock() the local_irq_disable()
is no longer needed. The code path is
  list_lru_shrink_count()
    -> list_lru_count_one()
      -> __list_lru_count_one()
        -> rcu_read_lock()
        -> list_lru_from_memcg_idx()
        -> rcu_read_unlock()

Remove the local_irq_disable() statement.
