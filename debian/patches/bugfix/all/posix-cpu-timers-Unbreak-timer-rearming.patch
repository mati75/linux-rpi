Subject: posix-cpu-timers: Unbreak timer rearming
Origin: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190111133500.840117406@linutronix.de/
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/919019
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/919049

The recent commit which prevented a division by 0 issue in the alarm timer
code broke posix CPU timers as an unwanted side effect.

The reason is that the common rearm code checks for timer->it_interval
being 0 now. What went unnoticed is that the posix cpu timer setup does not
initialize timer->it_interval as it stores the interval in CPU timer
specific storage. The reason for the separate storage is historical as the
posix CPU timers always had a 64bit nanoseconds representation internally
while timer->it_interval is type ktime_t which used to be a modified
timespec representation on 32bit machines.

Instead of reverting the offending commit and fixing the alarmtimer issue
in the alarmtimer code, store the interval in timer->it_interval at CPU
timer setup time so the common code check works. This also repairs the
existing inconistency of the posix CPU timer code which kept a single shot
timer armed despite of the interval being 0.

The separate storage can be removed in mainline, but that needs to be a
separate commit as the current one has to be backported to stable kernels.
