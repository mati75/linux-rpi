Subject: block: really disable runtime-pm for blk-mq
Date: Mon, 30 Jul 2018 20:02:19 +0800
Origin: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10548975/
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/904441

Runtime PM isn't ready for blk-mq yet, and commit 765e40b675a9 ("block:
disable runtime-pm for blk-mq") tried to disable it. Unfortunately,
it can't take effect in that way since user space still can switch
it on via 'echo auto > /sys/block/sdN/device/power/control'.

This patch disables runtime-pm for blk-mq really by pm_runtime_disable()
and fixes all kinds of PM related kernel crash.
