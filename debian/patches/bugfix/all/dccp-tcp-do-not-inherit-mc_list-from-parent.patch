Subject: dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/657831ffc38e30092a2d5f03d385d710eb88b09a
Bug-Debian-Security: https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8890

syzkaller found a way to trigger double frees from ip_mc_drop_socket()

It turns out that leave a copy of parent mc_list at accept() time,
which is very bad.

Very similar to commit 8b485ce69876 ("tcp: do not inherit
fastopen_req from parent")

Initial report from Pray3r, completed by Andrey one.
Thanks a lot to them !
