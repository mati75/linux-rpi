Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: imx53: correct clock-names of SATA node
Origin: http://git.kernel.org/linus/025781539a3ccf867c1e0f2fc63f61cc8c7c5415

Per the binding doc imx-sata.txt, the first entry of clock-names should
be "sata" than anything else.  Correct it for imx53 SATA node.

It works for now only because SATA driver gets clock by index so far.
