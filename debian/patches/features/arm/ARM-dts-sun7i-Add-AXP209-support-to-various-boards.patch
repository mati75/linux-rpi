Subject: [PATCH 2/7] ARM: dts: sun7i: Add AXP209 support to various boards
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/ec0c933d972ba69f06251f7d215723f61535fc16

At a node for the axp209, and where necessary the i2c controller to the dts
for various boards. Note the axp209 regulators are omitted as we don't have
any use for them yet, and on some boards were not sure how exactly they are
wired up.

Adding support for just the axp209 without the regulators is still useful, as
it will give us power-button and poweroff support.
