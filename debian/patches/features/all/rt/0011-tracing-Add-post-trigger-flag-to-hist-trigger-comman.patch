Subject: [PATCH 11/32] tracing: Add post-trigger flag to hist trigger command
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.11/older/patches-4.11.9-rt7.tar.xz

Add EVENT_CMD_FL_POST_TRIGGER to the hist trigger cmd - it doesn't
affect the hist trigger results, and allows further events such as
synthetic events to be generated from a hist trigger.

Without this change, generating an event from a hist trigger will
cause the generated event to fail a ring buffer trace_recursive_lock()
check and return without actually logging the event.
