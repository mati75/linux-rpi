Subject: [PATCH 36/37] tracing: Add inter-event blurb to HIST_TRIGGERS config
 option
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.14/older/patches-4.14.15-rt13.tar.xz

So that users know that inter-event tracing is supported as part of
the HIST_TRIGGERS option, include text to that effect in the help
text.
