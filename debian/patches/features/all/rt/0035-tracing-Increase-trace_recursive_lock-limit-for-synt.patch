Subject: [PATCH 35/37] tracing: Increase trace_recursive_lock() limit for
 synthetic events
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.14/older/patches-4.14.15-rt13.tar.xz

Synthetic event generation needs to happen while the current event is
still in progress, so add 1 to the trace_recursive_lock() recursion
limit to account for that.

Because we also want to allow for the possibility of a synthetic event
being generated from another synthetic event, add an additional
increment for that as well.
