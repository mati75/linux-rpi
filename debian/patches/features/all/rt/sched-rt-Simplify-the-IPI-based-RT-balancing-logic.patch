Subject: [PATCH] sched/rt: Simplify the IPI based RT balancing logic
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.14/older/patches-4.14.1-rt3.tar.xz

Upstream commit 4bdced5c9a2922521e325896a7bbbf0132c94e56

When a CPU lowers its priority (schedules out a high priority task for a
lower priority one), a check is made to see if any other CPU has overloaded
RT tasks (more than one). It checks the rto_mask to determine this and if so
it will request to pull one of those tasks to itself if the non running RT
task is of higher priority than the new priority of the next task to run on
the current CPU.

When we deal with large number of CPUs, the original pull logic suffered
from large lock contention on a single CPU run queue, which caused a huge
latency across all CPUs. This was caused by only having one CPU having
overloaded RT tasks and a bunch of other CPUs lowering their priority. To
solve this issue, commit:

  b6366f048e0c ("sched/rt: Use IPI to trigger RT task push migration instead of pulling")

changed the way to request a pull. Instead of grabbing the lock of the
overloaded CPU's runqueue, it simply sent an IPI to that CPU to do the work.

Although the IPI logic worked very well in removing the large latency build
up, it still could suffer from a large number of IPIs being sent to a single
CPU. On a 80 CPU box, I measured over 200us of processing IPIs. Worse yet,
when I tested this on a 120 CPU box, with a stress test that had lots of
RT tasks scheduling on all CPUs, it actually triggered the hard lockup
detector! One CPU had so many IPIs sent to it, and due to the restart
mechanism that is triggered when the source run queue has a priority status
change, the CPU spent minutes! processing the IPIs.

Thinking about this further, I realized there's no reason for each run queue
to send its own IPI. As all CPUs with overloaded tasks must be scanned
regardless if there's one or many CPUs lowering their priority, because
there's no current way to find the CPU with the highest priority task that
can schedule to one of these CPUs, there really only needs to be one IPI
being sent around at a time.

This greatly simplifies the code!

The new approach is to have each root domain have its own irq work, as the
rto_mask is per root domain. The root domain has the following fields
attached to it:

  rto_push_work	 - the irq work to process each CPU set in rto_mask
  rto_lock	 - the lock to protect some of the other rto fields
  rto_loop_start - an atomic that keeps contention down on rto_lock
		    the first CPU scheduling in a lower priority task
		    is the one to kick off the process.
  rto_loop_next	 - an atomic that gets incremented for each CPU that
		    schedules in a lower priority task.
  rto_loop	 - a variable protected by rto_lock that is used to
		    compare against rto_loop_next
  rto_cpu	 - The cpu to send the next IPI to, also protected by
		    the rto_lock.

When a CPU schedules in a lower priority task and wants to make sure
overloaded CPUs know about it. It increments the rto_loop_next. Then it
atomically sets rto_loop_start with a cmpxchg. If the old value is not "0",
then it is done, as another CPU is kicking off the IPI loop. If the old
value is "0", then it will take the rto_lock to synchronize with a possible
IPI being sent around to the overloaded CPUs.

If rto_cpu is greater than or equal to nr_cpu_ids, then there's either no
IPI being sent around, or one is about to finish. Then rto_cpu is set to the
first CPU in rto_mask and an IPI is sent to that CPU. If there's no CPUs set
in rto_mask, then there's nothing to be done.

When the CPU receives the IPI, it will first try to push any RT tasks that is
queued on the CPU but can't run because a higher priority RT task is
currently running on that CPU.

Then it takes the rto_lock and looks for the next CPU in the rto_mask. If it
finds one, it simply sends an IPI to that CPU and the process continues.

If there's no more CPUs in the rto_mask, then rto_loop is compared with
rto_loop_next. If they match, everything is done and the process is over. If
they do not match, then a CPU scheduled in a lower priority task as the IPI
was being passed around, and the process needs to start again. The first CPU
in rto_mask is sent the IPI.

This change removes this duplication of work in the IPI logic, and greatly
lowers the latency caused by the IPIs. This removed the lockup happening on
the 120 CPU machine. It also simplifies the code tremendously. What else
could anyone ask for?

Thanks to Peter Zijlstra for simplifying the rto_loop_start atomic logic and
supplying me with the rto_start_trylock() and rto_start_unlock() helper
functions.

- * up that may be able to run one of its non-running queued RT tasks.
- *
- * On large CPU boxes, there's the case that several CPUs could schedule
- * a lower priority task at the same time, in which case it will look for
- * any overloaded CPUs that it could pull a task from. To do this, the runqueue
- * lock must be taken from that overloaded CPU. Having 10s of CPUs all fighting
- * for a single overloaded CPU's runqueue lock can produce a large latency.
- * (This has actually been observed on large boxes running cyclictest).
- * Instead of taking the runqueue lock of the overloaded CPU, each of the
- * CPUs that scheduled a lower priority task simply sends an IPI to the
- * overloaded CPU. An IPI is much cheaper than taking an runqueue lock with
- * lots of contention. The overloaded CPU will look to push its non-running
- * RT task off, and if it does, it can then ignore the other IPIs coming
- * in, and just pass those IPIs off to any other overloaded CPU.
- *
- * When a CPU schedules a lower priority task, it only sends an IPI to
- * the "next" CPU that has overloaded RT tasks. This prevents IPI storms,
- * as having 10 CPUs scheduling lower priority tasks and 10 CPUs with
- * RT overloaded tasks, would cause 100 IPIs to go out at once.
- *
- * The overloaded RT CPU, when receiving an IPI, will try to push off its
- * overloaded RT tasks and then send an IPI to the next CPU that has
- * overloaded RT tasks. This stops when all CPUs with overloaded RT tasks
- * have completed. Just because a CPU may have pushed off its own overloaded
- * RT task does not mean it should stop sending the IPI around to other
- * overloaded CPUs. There may be another RT task waiting to run on one of
- * those CPUs that are of higher priority than the one that was just
- * pushed.
- *
- * An optimization that could possibly be made is to make a CPU array similar
- * to the cpupri array mask of all running RT tasks, but for the overloaded
- * case, then the IPI could be sent to only the CPU with the highest priority
- * RT task waiting, and that CPU could send off further IPIs to the CPU with
- * the next highest waiting task. Since the overloaded case is much less likely
- * to happen, the complexity of this implementation may not be worth it.
- * Instead, just send an IPI around to all overloaded CPUs.
- *
- * The rq->rt.push_flags holds the status of the IPI that is going around.
- * A run queue can only send out a single IPI at a time. The possible flags
- * for rq->rt.push_flags are:
- *
- *    (None or zero):		No IPI is going around for the current rq
- *    RT_PUSH_IPI_EXECUTING:	An IPI for the rq is being passed around
- *    RT_PUSH_IPI_RESTART:	The priority of the running task for the rq
- *				has changed, and the IPI should restart
- *				circulating the overloaded CPUs again.
- *
- * rq->rt.push_cpu contains the CPU that is being sent the IPI. It is updated
- * before sending to the next CPU.
- *
- * Instead of having all CPUs that schedule a lower priority task send
- * an IPI to the same "first" CPU in the RT overload mask, they send it
- * to the next overloaded CPU after their own CPU. This helps distribute
- * the work when there's more than one overloaded CPU and multiple CPUs
- * scheduling in lower priority tasks.
- *
- * When a rq schedules a lower priority task than what was currently
- * running, the next CPU with overloaded RT tasks is examined first.
- * That is, if CPU 1 and 5 are overloaded, and CPU 3 schedules a lower
- * priority task, it will send an IPI first to CPU 5, then CPU 5 will
- * send to CPU 1 if it is still overloaded. CPU 1 will clear the
- * rq->rt.push_flags if RT_PUSH_IPI_RESTART is not set.
- *
- * The first CPU to notice IPI_RESTART is set, will clear that flag and then
- * send an IPI to the next overloaded CPU after the rq->cpu and not the next
- * CPU after push_cpu. That is, if CPU 1, 4 and 5 are overloaded when CPU 3
- * schedules a lower priority task, and the IPI_RESTART gets set while the
- * handling is being done on CPU 5, it will clear the flag and send it back to
- * CPU 4 instead of CPU 1.
- *
- * Note, the above logic can be disabled by turning off the sched_feature
- * RT_PUSH_IPI. Then the rq lock of the overloaded CPU will simply be
- * taken by the CPU requesting a pull and the waiting RT task will be pulled
- * by that CPU. This may be fine for machines with few CPUs.
