Subject: [PATCH] posix-cpu-timers: remove lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled()

The lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() was a BUG_ON() statement in the
beginning and it was added just before the "spin_lock(siglock)"
statement to ensure this lock was taken with disabled interrupts.
This is no longer the case: the siglock is acquired via
lock_task_sighand() and this function already disables the interrupts.
The lock is also acquired before this "lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled" so
it is beset to remove it.
