Subject: [30/30] lockdown: Print current->comm in restriction messages
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit?id=b689e6ee3dd3bb3f325d850e1274ca8d51b48504

Print the content of current->comm in messages generated by lockdown to
indicate a restriction that was hit.  This makes it a bit easier to find
out what caused the message.

The message now patterned something like:

	Lockdown: <comm>: <what> is restricted; see man kernel_lockdown.7
