Subject: [44/61] kexec: Disable at runtime if the kernel is locked down
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs.git/commit?id=e7c340d3a52b23631aa5e67cd10eac766042db50

kexec permits the loading and execution of arbitrary code in ring 0, which
is something that lock-down is meant to prevent. It makes sense to disable
kexec in this situation.

This does not affect kexec_file_load() which can check for a signature on the
image to be booted.
