    net: lan78xx: Request s/w csum check on VLAN tagged packets.
    
    There appears to be some issue in the LAN78xx where the checksum
    computed on a VLAN tagged packet is incorrect, or at least not
    in the form that the kernel is after. This is most easily shown
    by pinging a device via a VLAN tagged interface and it will dump
    out the error message and stack trace from netdev_rx_csum_fault.
    It has also been seen with standard TCP and UDP packets.
    
    Until this is fully understood, request that the network stack
    computes the checksum on packets signalled as having a VLAN tag
    applied.
