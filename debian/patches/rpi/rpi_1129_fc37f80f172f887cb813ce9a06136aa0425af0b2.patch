    thermal: Compatible strings for bcm2836, bcm2837
    
    The upstream dt-bindings documentation for bcm2835-thermal (which
    exists even though the driver isn't upstreamed) says to use
    dedicated compatible strings on bcm2836 and bcm2837, even though
    the downstream driver doesn't support them. The Pi2 DTB uses
    "brcm,bcm2836-thermal", so the driver doesn't load. The Pi3 DTB
    doesn't override the base value, but the arm64 Pi3 support uses "brcm,bcm2837-thermal".
    
    Solve the documentation problem by adding "brcm,bcm2836-thermal" and
    "brcm,bcm2837-thermal" as alternative compatible strings for the
    bcm2835-thermal driver.
