    USB_DWCOTG: Disable building dwc_otg as a module (#2265)
    
    When dwc_otg is built as a module, build will fail with the following
    error:
    
    ERROR: "DWC_TASK_HI_SCHEDULE" [drivers/usb/host/dwc_otg/dwc_otg.ko] undefined!
    scripts/Makefile.modpost:91: recipe for target '__modpost' failed
    make[1]: *** [__modpost] Error 1
    Makefile:1199: recipe for target 'modules' failed
    make: *** [modules] Error 2
    
    Even if the error is solved by including the missing
    DWC_TASK_HI_SCHEDULE function, the kernel will panic when loading
    dwc_otg.
    
    As a workaround, simply prevent user from building dwc_otg as a module
    as the current kernel does not support it.
