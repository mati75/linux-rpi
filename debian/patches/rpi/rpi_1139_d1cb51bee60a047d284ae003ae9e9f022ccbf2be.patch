    amba_pl011: Add cts-event-workaround DT property
    
    The BCM2835 PL011 implementation seems to have a bug that can lead to a
    transmission lockup if CTS changes frequently. A workaround was added to
    the driver with a vendor-specific flag to enable it, but this flag is
    currently not set for ARM implementations.
    
    Add a "cts-event-workaround" property to Pi DTBs and use the presence
    of that property to force the flag to be enabled in the driver.
