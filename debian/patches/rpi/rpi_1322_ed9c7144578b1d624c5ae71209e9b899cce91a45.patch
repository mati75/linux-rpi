    Drivers: hv: util: Fcopy: Fix a rescind processing issue
    
    commit 20951c7535b5e6af46bc37b7142105f716df739c upstream.
    
    Fcopy may use a char device to support the communication between
    the user level daemon and the driver. When the Fcopy channel is rescinded
    we need to make sure that the char device is fully cleaned up before
    we can process a new Fcopy offer from the host. Implement this logic.
