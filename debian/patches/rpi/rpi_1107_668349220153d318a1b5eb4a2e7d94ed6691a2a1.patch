    ARM64: Fix build break for RTL8187/RTL8192CU wifi
    
    These drivers use an ASM function from the base
    system to compute the ipv6 checksum.  These functions
    are not available on ARM64, probably because nobody
    has bother to write them.  The base system does have
    a generic "C" version, so a simple fix is to include
    the header to use the generic version on ARM64 only.
    
    A longer term solution would be to submit the necessary
    ASM function to the upstream source.
    
    With this change, these drivers now compile without
    any errors on ARM64.
