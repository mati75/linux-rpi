    ASoC: wm8804: MCLK configuration options, 32-bit
    
    WM8804 can run with PLL frequencies of 256xfs and 128xfs for most sample
    rates. At 192kHz only 128xfs is supported. The existing driver selects
    128xfs automatically for some lower samples rates. By using an
    additional mclk_div divider, it is now possible to control the
    behaviour. This allows using 256xfs PLL frequency on all sample rates up
    to 96kHz. It should allow lower jitter and better signal quality. The
    behavior has to be controlled by the sound card driver, because some
    sample frequency share the same setting. e.g. 192kHz and 96kHz use
    24.576MHz master clock. The only difference is the MCLK divider.
    
    This also added support for 32bit data.
