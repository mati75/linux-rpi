    amba_pl011: Don't use DT aliases for numbering
    
    The pl011 driver looks for DT aliases of the form "serial<n>",
    and if found uses <n> as the device ID. This can cause
    /dev/ttyAMA0 to become /dev/ttyAMA1, which is confusing if the
    other serial port is provided by the 8250 driver which doesn't
    use the same logic.
