    BCM27XX_DT: Delete 'stdout-path' property
    
    The 'stdout-path' property introduced upstream changes the behaviour
    on a non-Bluetooth Pi by enabling a console on UART0 when the user
    may not want one. The boot order is such that /dev/console ends up
    on the serial port instead of tty0.
    
    Delete the property in downstream DTBs to retrurn to the previous
    behaviour of only enabling consoles selected in cmdline.txt.
