    drm/vc4: Use correct path to trace include
    
    The header comment in include/trace/define_trace.h specifies that the
    TRACE_INCLUDE_PATH needs to be relative to the define_trace.h header
    rather than the trace file including it. Most instances get that wrong
    and work around it by adding the $(src) directory to the include path.
    
    While this works, it is preferable to refer to the correct path to the
    trace file in the first place and avoid any workaround.
