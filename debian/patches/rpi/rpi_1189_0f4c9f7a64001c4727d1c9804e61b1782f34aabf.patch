commit 0f4c9f7a64001c4727d1c9804e61b1782f34aabf

    BCM270X_DT: Add SMSC ethernet controller to DT
    
    With an ethernet node in the DT, a suitable firmware can populate the
    local-mac-address property, removing the need for a downstream patch
    to the driver to read its MAC address from a module parameter.
