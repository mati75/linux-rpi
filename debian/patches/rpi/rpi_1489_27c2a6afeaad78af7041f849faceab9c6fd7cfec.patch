    brcmfmac: Make skb header writable before use
    
    The driver was making changes to the skb_header without
    ensuring it was writable (i.e. uncloned).
    This patch also removes some boiler plate header size
    checking/adjustment code as that is also handled by the
    skb_cow_header function used to make header writable.
