    ARM: dts: Add model-specific compatible strings
    
    The upstream Pi DTs are model-specific, with both the model and
    compatible strings identifying the model. Downstream groups the
    closely-related models, with only the chip name in the compatible
    strings and a model string patched by the firmware.
    
    Bring the downstream model-specific DTs closer to upstream by
    adding model-specific compatible strings.
