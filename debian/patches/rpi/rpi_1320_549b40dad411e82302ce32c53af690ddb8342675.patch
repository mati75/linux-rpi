    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix a rescind handling bug
    
    commit ccb61f8a99e6c29df4fb96a65dad4fad740d5be9 upstream.
    
    The host can rescind a channel that has been offered to the
    guest and once the channel is rescinded, the host does not
    respond to any requests on that channel. Deal with the case where
    the guest may be blocked waiting for a response from the host.
