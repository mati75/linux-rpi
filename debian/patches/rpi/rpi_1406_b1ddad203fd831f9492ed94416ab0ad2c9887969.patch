    tun: fix premature POLLOUT notification on tun devices
    
    [ Upstream commit b20e2d54789c6acbf6bd0efdbec2cf5fa4d90ef1 ]
    
    aszlig observed failing ssh tunnels (-w) during initialization since
    commit cc9da6cc4f56e0 ("ipv6: addrconf: use stable address generator for
    ARPHRD_NONE"). We already had reports that the mentioned commit breaks
    Juniper VPN connections. I can't clearly say that the Juniper VPN client
    has the same problem, but it is worth a try to hint to this patch.
    
    Because of the early generation of link local addresses, the kernel now
    can start asking for routers on the local subnet much earlier than usual.
    Those router solicitation packets arrive inside the ssh channels and
    should be transmitted to the tun fd before the configuration scripts
    might have upped the interface and made it ready for transmission.
    
    ssh polls on the interface and receives back a POLL_OUT. It tries to send
    the earily router solicitation packet to the tun interface.  Unfortunately
    it hasn't been up'ed yet by config scripts, thus failing with -EIO. ssh
    doesn't retry again and considers the tun interface broken forever.
