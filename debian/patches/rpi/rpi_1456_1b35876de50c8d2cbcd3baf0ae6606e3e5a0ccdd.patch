    bcache: Fix leak of bdev reference
    
    commit 4b758df21ee7081ab41448d21d60367efaa625b3 upstream.
    
    If blkdev_get_by_path() in register_bcache() fails, we try to lookup the
    block device using lookup_bdev() to detect which situation we are in to
    properly report error. However we never drop the reference returned to
    us from lookup_bdev(). Fix that.
