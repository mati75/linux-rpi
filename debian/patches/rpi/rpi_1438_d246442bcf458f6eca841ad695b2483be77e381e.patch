+        relative_axis           register a relative axis rather than an
+                                absolute one. Relative axis will only
+                                generate +1/-1 events on the input device,
+                                hence no steps need to be passed.
+        linux_axis              the input subsystem axis to map to this
+                                rotary encoder. Defaults to 0 (ABS_X / REL_X)
+        rollover                Automatic rollover when the rotary value
+                                becomes greater than the specified steps or
+                                smaller than 0. For absolute axis only.
+        steps-per-period        Number of steps (stable states) per period.
+                                The values have the following meaning:
+                                1: Full-period mode (default)
+                                2: Half-period mode
+                                4: Quarter-period mode
+        steps                   Number of steps in a full turnaround of the
+                                encoder. Only relevant for absolute axis.
+                                Defaults to 24 which is a typical value for
+                                such devices.
+        wakeup                  Boolean, rotary encoder can wake up the
+                                system.
+        encoding                String, the method used to encode steps.
+                                Supported are "gray" (the default and more
+                                common) and "binary".
