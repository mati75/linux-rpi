    drm/amdgpu: Need to set moved to true when evict bo
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ddd9769db4fc11a98bd7e58be1764e47fdb8384 ]
    
    Fix the VMC page fault when the running sequence is as below:
    1.amdgpu_gem_create_ioctl
    2.ttm_bo_swapout->amdgpu_vm_bo_invalidate, as not called
    amdgpu_vm_bo_base_init, so won't called
    list_add_tail(&base->bo_list, &bo->va). Even the bo was evicted,
    it won't set the bo_base->moved.
    3.drm_gem_open_ioctl->amdgpu_vm_bo_base_init, here only called
    list_move_tail(&base->vm_status, &vm->evicted), but not set the
    bo_base->moved.
    4.amdgpu_vm_bo_map->amdgpu_vm_bo_insert_map, as the bo_base->moved is
    not set true, the function amdgpu_vm_bo_insert_map will call
    list_move(&bo_va->base.vm_status, &vm->moved)
    5.amdgpu_cs_ioctl won't validate the swapout bo, as it is only in the
    moved list, not in the evict list. So VMC page fault occurs.
