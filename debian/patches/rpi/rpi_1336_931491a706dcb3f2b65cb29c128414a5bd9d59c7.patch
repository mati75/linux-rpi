commit 931491a706dcb3f2b65cb29c128414a5bd9d59c7
Author: James Hughes <james.hughes@raspberrypi.org>

    Sets the BCDC priority to constant 0
    
    This is to workaround for a possible issue in the
    wireless chip firmware where some packets with
    higher priorities seem to go missing.
    
    See https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1342 for
    details.
