    i2c: bcm2835: Use dev_dbg logging on transfer errors
    
    Writing to an AT24C32 generates on average 2x i2c transfer errors per
    32-byte page write. Which amounts to a lot for a 4k write. This is due
    to the fact that the chip doesn't respond during it's internal write
    cycle when the at24 driver tries and retries the next write.
    Only a handful drivers use dev_err() on transfer error, so switch to
    dev_dbg() instead.
