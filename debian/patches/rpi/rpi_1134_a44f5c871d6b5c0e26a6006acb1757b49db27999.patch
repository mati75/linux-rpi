    staging: vchiq_arm: Remove unused variable
    
    This warning appears with GCC 6.4.0 from toolchains.bootlin.com:
    
    ../drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c: In function ‘vchiq_open’:
    ../drivers/staging/vc04_services/interface/vchiq_arm/vchiq_arm.c:1735:7: warning: unused variable ‘ret’ [-Wunused-variable]
       int ret;
           ^~~
    
    This variable's usage was removed by commit 3c980263c592 ("staging:
    vchiq_arm: Make debugfs failure non-fatal"), making it useless.
