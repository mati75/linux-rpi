    arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]
    
    When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
    decode_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.
    
    Having this logic in decode_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
    before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
    consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
    an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.
    
    Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state *after* the effects of the
    instruction are emulated.
