commit eae0d0cdaf10ce57499f06c68f56f8512bce91e4

    Sets the BCDC priority to constant 0
    
    This is to workaround for a possible issue in the
    wireless chip firmware where some packets with
    higher priorities seem to go missing.
    
    See https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/1342 for
    details.
