    drm/vc4: Fix double destroy of the BO cache on teardown.
    
    It's also destroyed from the top level vc4_drv.c initialization, which
    is where the cache was actually initialized from.
    
    This used to just involve duplicate del_timer() and cancel_work_sync()
    being called, but it started causing kmalloc issues once we
    double-freed the new BO label array.
    
    Fixes: 1908a876f909 ("drm/vc4: Add an ioctl for labeling GEM BOs for summary stats")
