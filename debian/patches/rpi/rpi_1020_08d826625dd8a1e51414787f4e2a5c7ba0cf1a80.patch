    clk: bcm2835: Mark GPIO clocks enabled at boot as critical.
    
    These divide off of PLLD_PER and are used for the ethernet and wifi
    PHYs source PLLs.  Neither of them is currently represented by a phy
    device that would grab the clock for us.
    
    This keeps other drivers from killing the networking PHYs when they
    disable their own clocks and trigger PLLD_PER's refcount going to 0.
    
    v2: Skip marking as critical if they aren't on at boot.
