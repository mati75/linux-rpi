 Using Overlays
 ==============
 
-Overlays are loaded using the "dtoverlay" directive. As an example, consider
-the popular lirc-rpi module, the Linux Infrared Remote Control driver. In the
-pre-DT world this would be loaded from /etc/modules, with an explicit
-"modprobe lirc-rpi" command, or programmatically by lircd. With DT enabled,
-this becomes a line in config.txt:
+Overlays are loaded using the "dtoverlay" config.txt setting. As an example,
+consider I2C Real Time Clock drivers. In the pre-DT world these would be loaded
+by writing a magic string comprising a device identifier and an I2C address to
+a special file in /sys/class/i2c-adapter, having first loaded the driver for
+the I2C interface and the RTC device - something like this:
 
-    dtoverlay=lirc-rpi
+    modprobe i2c-bcm2835
+    modprobe rtc-ds1307
+    echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device
 
-This causes the file /boot/overlays/lirc-rpi.dtbo to be loaded. By
-default it will use GPIOs 17 (out) and 18 (in), but this can be modified using
-DT parameters:
+With DT enabled, this becomes a line in config.txt:
 
-    dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_out_pin=17,gpio_in_pin=13
+    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307
 
-Parameters always have default values, although in some cases (e.g. "w1-gpio")
-it is necessary to provided multiple overlays in order to get the desired
-behaviour. See the list of overlays below for a description of the parameters
+This causes the file /boot/overlays/i2c-rtc.dtbo to be loaded and a "node"
+describing the DS1307 I2C device to be added to the Device Tree for the Pi. By
+default it usees address 0x68, but this can be modified with an additional DT
+parameter:
+
+    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307,addr=0x68

+Parameters usually have default values, although certain parameters are
+mandatory. See the list of overlays below for a description of the parameters
 and their defaults.
