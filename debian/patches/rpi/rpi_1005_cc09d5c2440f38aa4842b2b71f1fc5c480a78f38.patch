    irq-bcm2836: Prevent spurious interrupts, and trap them early
    
    The old arch-specific IRQ macros included a dsb to ensure the
    write to clear the mailbox interrupt completed before returning
    from the interrupt. The BCM2836 irqchip driver needs the same
    precaution to avoid spurious interrupts.
    
    Spurious interrupts are still possible for other reasons,
    though, so trap them early.
