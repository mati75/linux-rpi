    mcp2515: Use DT-supplied interrupt flags
    
    The MCP2515 datasheet clearly describes a level-triggered interrupt
    pin. Therefore the receiving interrupt controller must also be
    configured for level-triggered operation otherwise there is a danger
    of a missed interrupt condition blocking all subsequent interrupts.
    The ONESHOT flag ensures that the interrupt is masked until the
    threaded interrupt handler exits.
    
    Rather than change the flags globally (they must have worked for at
    least one user), allow the flags to be overridden from Device Tree
    in the event that the device has a DT node.
