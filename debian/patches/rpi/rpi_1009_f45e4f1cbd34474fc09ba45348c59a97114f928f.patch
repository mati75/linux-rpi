    irq_bcm2836: Send event when onlining sleeping cores
    
    In order to reduce power consumption and bus traffic, it is sensible
    for secondary cores to enter a low-power idle state when waiting to
    be started. The wfe instruction causes a core to wait until an event
    or interrupt arrives before continuing to the next instruction.
    The sev instruction sends a wakeup event to the other cores, so call
    it from bcm2836_smp_boot_secondary, the function that wakes up the
    waiting cores during booting.
    
    It is harmless to use this patch without the corresponding change
    adding wfe to the ARMv7/ARMv8-32 stubs, but if the stubs are updated
    and this patch is not applied then the other cores will sleep forever.
