Subject: arm64: ptrace: Avoid ABI change in 3.16.42
Forwarded: not-needed

Commit aeb1f39d814b "arm64/ptrace: Avoid uninitialised struct padding
in fpr_set()" added a new member to struct user_fpsimd_state, but it
takes the place of what was padding (for 128-bit alignment).  Hide
this from genksyms.
