Subject: xfrm: Avoid ABI change in 3.16.48
Forwarded: not-needed

Commit 9b3eb54106cf6acd03f07cf0ab01c13676a226c2 "xfrm: fix stack
access out of bounds with CONFIG_XFRM_SUB_POLICY" removed two members
from xfrm_dst that were written and never read.  We should retain them
as always-zero to avoid ABI breakage.
