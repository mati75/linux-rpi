    staging: bcm2835-camera: Check the error for REPEAT_SEQ_HEADER (#2782)
    
    When handling for V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_REPEAT_SEQ_HEADER was added
    the firmware would reject the setting if H264 hadn't already been
    selected. This was fixed in the firmware at that point, but to
    enable backwards compatibility the returned error was ignored.
    
    That was Dec 2013, so the chances of having a firmware that still
    has that issue is so close to zero that the workaround can be
    removed.
